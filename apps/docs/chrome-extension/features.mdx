# Features

- **Start a New Session**: Users have the ability to start a new session directly from the Chrome extension.

- **View All Sessions**: Users can view all their sessions within the extension, allowing them to access session information from any website.

- **Authenticate a Website**: Users can authenticate any website they are on by opening the Chrome extension and clicking the "Authenticate a Website" button. This feature saves the website's cookies to the backend, where they are encrypted for secure storage. This allows Allyson to use the cookies to log back into the website automatically during task execution.
