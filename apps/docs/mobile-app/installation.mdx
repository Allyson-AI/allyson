## Download from Apple App Store

To get started with the Allyson iOS App, download it from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id6593659141). Simply search for "Allyson" and click "Get" to install it.

After installing the app, you will be prompted to login with your Allyson account. If you don't have an account, you can just enter your email and a code will be sent to your email to verify your account.

Once you have logged in, enable your notifications, and then you will be able to load your balance, and start using the app.
